## Listening modes

## Select from list

As from v0.9.0 listening modes are available as so called `simple commands`:

## Text input instead of selecting from list

Like descibed in the Cheats section, you can send a lot of different commands which are all mentioned in the [JSON](../src/eiscp-commands.ts) file.

Probably you have your AVR set to automatically select the best listening mode, but sometimes you might want to set a favorite mode, see the listening-mode section in the [JSON](../src/eiscp-commands.ts), for the correct command. A few examples from that JSON:

| Listening mode (selectable)         | text alternative: value in `Input source`          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Stereo                              | listening-mode stereo                              |
| Straight Decode                     | listening-mode straight-decode                     |
| Neo:6/Neo:X THX Cinema              | listening-mode thx-cinema                          |
| Neo:6 Cinema DTS Surround Sensation | listening-mode neo-6-cinema-dts-surround-sensation |

## What about `Dolby Atmos`, `DTS:X`, `Auro-3D`, `IMAX Enhanced`?

eISCP codes for Atmos, DTS:X, Auro-3D, and IMAX Enhanced are not standardized and may vary by receiver model and firmware.

However, most models `auto-select` the correct mode when the input signal is `Dolby Atmos`, `DTS:X`, `Auro-3D`, `IMAX Enhanced` and the listening mode is set to `Straight Decode`.

| Listening mode | Setup           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Dolby Atmos    | straight-decode |
| DTS:X          | straight-decode |
| Auro-3D        | straight-decode |
| IMAX Enhanced  | straight-decode |

## Select widget

As from version 0.8.0, the integration offers a `select` widget for listening modes, see [this doc](select-listening-mode.md).

Different models sometimes use different names for a single listening mode, You can use that functionality to quickly discover which listening modes are accepted by your AVR model.
