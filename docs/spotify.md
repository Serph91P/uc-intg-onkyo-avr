## Spotify

It's best to create an activity for Spotify and select it when you send music from your Spotify app to your AVR. Next time you select this activity and hit `play` on the remote, it will try to continue where you left it last time.

This integration will try to collect the album art, artist, title and album. All this is collected from the AVR, this integration does not communicate with Spotify directly. Also `play/pause`, `next` and `previous` will be send to the AVR, the AVR will handle the communicatio with your Spotify app.

### Spotify activity

To set up an Activity for Spotify, have a look at these screenshots:

- Create activity and prevent sleep

- On sequence, Input source: `input-selector spotify`

- User interface, add mediawidget for the AVR with maximum size

- Button mapping: map to the buttons you prefer (for example previous/next can be mapped to channel up/down):
  - volume up/down
  - play/pause
  - previous/next
  - mute

Previous/Next on the remote will only work if you can also use previous/next directly in your Spotify app, that depends on the subscription you have for Spotify.

If `input-selector spotify` does not work, check the manual of your AVR to see if Spotify is even available as selectable input on the AVR:

- your AVR _does_ have a Spotify input: run setup of this integration again and increase the value for 'NET sub-source selection delay'
- your AVR does _not_ have a Spotify input, just try `input-selector net`, see [input-selector](./input-selector.md#net) for more info
